## Background

**2** Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

## PyBank

* Dataset: [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

* Task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

* Dataset: [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. 

* The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.


* In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
